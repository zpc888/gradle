[[attribute_based_matching]]
= Attribute based matching in dependency resolution

This chapter is primarily aimed towards plugin authors who want to understand better how to leverage the capabilities of the dependency resolution engine to support variant-aware dependency management.
Users who simply want to understand what configuration attributes are will also find support here.

[[sec:abm_configuration_kinds]]
== Different kinds of configurations

Historically, <<managing_dependency_configurations.adoc#sub:what_is_a_configuration,configurations>>  have been at the root of dependency resolution in Gradle.
In the end, what we want to make a difference is between a _consumer_ and a _producer_. For this purpose, configurations are used for at least 3 different aspects:

1. to declare dependencies
2. as a _consumer_, to resolve a set of dependencies to files
3. as a _producer_, to expose artifacts for consumption by other projects

For example, if I want to express that my application `app` _depends on_ library `lib`, we need _at least_ one configuration:

.Configurations are used to declare dependencies
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=declare-configuration]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=declare-configuration]"]
====

Configurations can extend other configuration, in order to inherit their dependencies.
However, the code above doesn't tell anything about the _consumer_.
In particular, it doesn't tell what is the _use_ of the configuration.
Let's say that `lib` is a Java library: it can expose different things, such as its API, implementation or test fixtures.
If we want to resolve the dependencies of `app`, we need to know what kind of task we're performing (compiling against the API of `lib`, executing the application, compiling tests, ...).
For this purpose, you'll often find companion configurations, which are meant to unambiguously declare the usage:

.Configurations representing concrete dependency graphs
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=concrete-classpath]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=concrete-classpath]"]
====

At this stage, we have 3 different configurations, which already have different goals:

- `someConfiguration` declares the dependencies of my application. It's just a bucket where we declare a list of dependencies.
- `compileClasspath` and `runtimeClasspath` are configurations _meant to be resolved_: when resolved they should contain respectively the compile classpath, and the runtime classpath of the application.

This is actually represented on the `Configuration` type by the `canBeResolved` flag.
A configuration that _can be resolved_ is a configuration for which we can compute a dependency graph, because it contains all the necessary information for resolution to happen.
That is to say we're going to compute a dependency graph, resolve the components in the graph, and eventually get artifacts.
A configuration which has `canBeResolved` set to `false` is not meant to be resolved.
Such a configuration is there _only to declare dependencies_.
The reason is that depending on the usage (compile classpath, runtime classpath), it _can_ resolve to different graphs.
It is an error to try to resolve a configuration which has `canBeResolved` set to `false`.
To some extent, this is similar to an _abstract class_ (`canBeResolved`=false) which is not supposed to be instantiated, and a concrete class extending the abstract class (`canBeResolved`=true).
A resolvable configuration will extend at least one non resolvable configuration (and may extend more than one).

On the other end, at the library project side (the _producer_), we also use configurations to represent what can be consumed.
For example, the library may expose an API or a runtime, and we would attach artifacts to either one, the other, or both.
Typically, to compile against `lib`, we need the API of `lib`, but we don't need its runtime dependencies.
So the `lib` project will expose an `apiElements` configuration, which is aimed for consumers looking for its API.
Such a configuration is going to be consumable, but is not meant to be resolved.
This is expressed via the _canBeConsumed_ flag of a `Configuration`:

.Setting up configurations
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=setup-configurations]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=setup-configurations]"]
====

In short, a configuration role is determined by the `canBeResolved` and `canBeConsumed` flag combinations:

.Configuration roles
|===
|Configuration role|can be resolved|can be consumed
|Bucket of dependencies|false|false
|Resolve for certain usage|true|false
|Exposed to consumers|false|true
|Legacy, don't use|true|true
|===

For backwards compatibility, those flags have both `true` as the default value, but as a plugin author, you should always determine the right values for those flags, or you might accidentally introduce resolution errors.

[[sec:abm_configuration_attributes]]
== Configuration attributes

We have explained that we have 3 configuration roles, and explained that we may want to resolve the compile and runtime classpath differently, but there's nothing in what we've written which allows explaining the difference.
This is where _attributes_ come into play.
The role of attributes is to perform the selection of the right _variant_ of a component.
In our example, the `lib` library exposes 2 variants: its API (via `exposedApi`) and its runtime (via `exposedRuntime`).
There's no restriction on the number of variants a component can expose.
We may, for example, want to expose the test fixtures of a component too.
But then, the consumer needs to explain _what_ configuration to consume, and this is done by setting _attributes_ on both the _consumer_ and _producer_ ends.

Attributes consist of a _name_ and a _value_ pair.
Gradle comes with a standard attribute named `org.gradle.usage` specifically to deal with the concept of selecting the right variant of a component based on the usage of the consumer (compile, runtime ...).
It is however possible to define an arbitrary number of attributes.
As a producer, I can express that a consumable configuration represents the API of a component by attaching the `(org.gradle.usage,JAVA_API)` attribute to the configuration.
As a consumer, I can express that I need the API of the dependencies of a resolvable configuration by attaching the `(org.gradle.usage,JAVA_API)` attribute to it.
Now Gradle has a way to _automatically select the appropriate variant_ by looking at the configuration attributes:
- the consumer wants `org.gradle.usage=JAVA_API`
- the dependent project exposes 2 different variants. One with `org.gradle.usage=JAVA_API`, the other with `org.gradle.usage=JAVA_RUNTIME`.
- Gradle selects the `org.gradle.usage=JAVA_API` variant

In other words: attributes are used to perform the selection based on the values of the attributes.
It doesn't matter what the names of the configurations are: only the attributes matter.

[[sec:abm_declaring_attributes]]
== Declaring attributes

Attributes are _typed_. An attribute can be created via the `Attribute<T>.of` method:

.Define attributes
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=define_attribute]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=define_attribute]"]
====

Currently, only attribute types of `String`, or anything extending `Named` is supported.
Attributes must be declared in the _attribute schema_ found on the `dependencies` handler:

.Registering attributes on the attributes schema
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=register-attributes]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=register-attributes]"]
====

Then configurations can be configured to set values for attributes:

.Setting attributes on configurations
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=attributes-on-configurations]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=attributes-on-configurations]"]
====

For attributes which type extends `Named`, the value of the attribute **must** be created via the _object factory_:

.Named attributes
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=named-attributes]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/snippets/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=named-attributes]"]
====

[[sec:abm_compatibility_rules]]
== Attribute compatibility rules

Attributes let the engine select _compatible variants_.
However, there are cases where a provider may not have _exactly_ what the consumer wants, but still something that it can use.
For example, if the consumer is asking for the API of a library, there's a possibility that the producer doesn't have such a variant, but only a _runtime_ variant.
This is typical of libraries published on external repositories.
In this case, we know that even if we don't have an exact match (API), we can still compile against the runtime variant (it contains _more_ than what we need to compile but it's still ok to use).
To deal with this, Gradle provides link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/attributes/AttributeCompatibilityRule.html[attribute compatibility rules].
The role of a compatibility rule is to explain what variants are _compatible_ with what the consumer asked for.

Attribute compatibility rules have to be registered via the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/attributes/AttributeMatchingStrategy.html[attribute matching strategy] that you can obtain from the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/attributes/AttributesSchema.html[attributes schema].

[[sec:abm_disambiguation_rules]]
== Attribute disambiguation rules

Because multiple values for an attribute can be _compatible_ with the requested attribute, Gradle needs to choose between the candidates.
This is done by implementing an link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/attributes/AttributeDisambiguationRule.html[attribute disambiguation rule].

Attribute disambiguation rules have to be registered via the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/attributes/AttributeMatchingStrategy.html[attribute matching strategy] that you can obtain from the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/attributes/AttributesSchema.html[attributes schema].

[[sec:abm_artifact_transforms]]
== Artifact Transforms

There can be rules how to transform one variant into another variant with different attributes.
For example, going from the artifact type `jar` to the artifact type `java-classes-directory` can be achieved by unzipping the jar.
Those rules are called _Artifact Transforms_.

Artifact transforms are registered on the project consuming the dependencies with the transformed attributes.
The registration includes the from and to attributes of the transform and the transform action to execute.

For example, given an `Unzip` transform as described above, registration would look like this:

.Artifact transform registration
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/unzip/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-registration]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/unzip/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-registration]"]
====

After that registration, every time a module with artifact type `java-classes-directory` is requested, but the module only has a variant of type `jar`, the `jar` is unpacked and the directory with the classes is provided to the resolved configuration.

Note that artifact transforms are executed in parallel by default.

=== Registering Artifact Transforms

For registering an artifact transform, the method `dependencies.registerTransform` is used.
As part of the registration, the `from` and `to` attributes need to be supplied.
When required, parameters for the transform can be configured.

The artifact transform needs to be registered in the project which consumes the transformed artifacts.

.Artifact transform registration with parameters
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/relocate/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-registration]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/relocate/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-registration]"]
====

=== Implementing Artifact Transforms

Similar to tasks, an artifact transform consists of an action and some parameters.
The major difference to tasks is that the parameters and the action are two separate classes.
The action implements `TransformAction` and the parameters implement `TransformParameters`.

For each artifact produced by the transform, `TransformOutputs.dir` or `TransformOutputs.file` need to be called.
If the provided path is the input artifact or in the input artifact (for an input directory), the selected file is returned.
If the argument to `dir` or `file` is a relative path, an output location is returned from the method.
The transform action is then expected to create the transformed artifact in the provided location.

The produced artifacts replace the input artifact in the order they were registered in the transformed variant.

We start with an artifact transform which does not require parameters.
The `Unzip` transform described above is a good candidate.
This is what the implementation looks like:

.Artifact transform without parameters
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/unzip/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-unzip]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/unzip/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-unzip]"]
====
<1> Use `TransformParameters.None` if the transform does not use parameters
<2> Inject the input artifact
<3> Request on output location for the unzipped files
<4> Do the actual work of the transform

An artifact transform may require parameters, like a `String` determining some filter, or some file collection which is used for supporting the transformation of the input artifact.
In order to pass those parameters to the transform action, you need to define a new type with the desired parameters.
The type needs to implement the marker interface `TransformParameters`.
The properties should be <<lazy_configuration.adoc#sec:lazy_properties,read-only configurable properties>>.
Use an interface declaring the getters and Gradle will generate the implementation.
All getters need to have proper input annotations, see the table in the section on <<more_about_tasks.adoc#table:incremental_build_annotations,incremental build>>.

Additionally to user provided parameters, an artifact transform may also be interested in the dependencies of its input artifact.
By using the `@InputArtifactDependencies` annotation you can inject the `FileCollection` which will contain the dependencies of the input artifact when the action executes.
Note that using input artifact dependencies in a transform has performance implications, they should only be injected when required.

Moreover, artifact transforms can make use of the <<build_cache.adoc#build_cache,build cache>> for caching their outputs.
To enable the build cache for an artifact transform, add the `@CacheableTransform` annotation on the action class.
For a cacheable transform, it is required to annotate the `@InputArtifact` and `@InputArtifactDependencies` (when present) with normalization annotations, like e.g. `@PathSensitive`.

The following example shows the above features on a transform which relocates classes.

.Artifact transform for class relocation
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/relocate/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-relocate]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/relocate/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-relocate]"]
====
<1> Declare the transform cacheable
<2> Interface for the transform parameters
<3> Declare input type for each parameter
<4> Declare a normalization for the input artifact
<5> Inject the input artifact dependencies
<6> Use the parameters

=== Incremental Artifact Transforms

Similar to <<custom_tasks#incremental_tasks,incremental tasks>>, artifact transforms may only process changed files since the last execution.
This is done by using `InputChanges` interface.
For artifact transforms, only the input artifact is an incremental input, and therefore the transform can only query for changes there.
In order to use `InputChanges` in the transform action, inject it into the action.
For more information on how to use `InputChanges`, see the corresponding documentation for <<custom_tasks#incremental_tasks,incremental tasks>>.

Here is an example of an incremental transform which counts the lines of code in Java source files:

.Artifact transform for lines of code counting
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/incremental/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-transform-countloc]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/artifactTransforms/incremental/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-transform-countloc]"]
====
<1> Inject `InputChanges`
<2> Query for changes in the input artifact
